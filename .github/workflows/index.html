                            The game only saves boring stuff that helps it work, like your high score, what level you're on, or maybe if you turned the volume down because you got too scared.

                            Meleper uses stuff like PlayFab (backend services) to run the game (it's how the monster finds the survivors!). For **co-op multiplayer**, these services need technical info, like your device's **IP address**, just so your headset can find the other players and connect to the game server.

Play with friends or in a public place so you have someone to scream with. I'm just trying to help you stay safe (and maybe share the jumpscares).

                        **Pro Tip:** Always check your battery is at least 50% before starting a game of Meleper. Losing to the monster is okay, but losing to the battery is just sad.
